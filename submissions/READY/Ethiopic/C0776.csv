The main body of the text is written in 2 columns of 15 lines, in black with the usual rubrics (opening lines of individual texts, the name of Mary, the original owner's names, partially erased, and major punctuation.), in a moderately large hand (7-9 mm in height) in a cursive gwelh or räqiq script. The leaves towards the end of the MS [fols. 105-150] are written in a somewhat larger gwelh hand [10-12mm] in 2 columns of 11 lines. Original pricking and ruling is visible throughout. There are 59 paintings, 52 of which are full-page and the others part or half-page, most of which are protected by muslin panels sewn on to the leaves. There is also a small detached painted leaf sewn to a blank leaf at the back of the MS [fol. 151]. All the paintings are executed in the Second Gondarene style. The MS is bound between wooden boards covered in tooled red-brown leather. Illumination: There are 59 full-page paintings illustrating 32 miracles, all painted in the classic court style that developed in Gondar during Dawit's reign. The style is initially dependent on European engravings but is here fully refashioned in a narrow range of figure types and brilliant colours. It can be closely compared with a painting in a manuscript of the Legends of Mary made for King Bäkaffa around 1721 and now in the British Library (British Library, Or. 603). The style of the paintings, which is a particularly fine example of the Second Gondarene period of painting, conforms with a date in the first half of the eighteenth century. This style with its heavily modelled features, rich colouring and solid backgrounds, is normally associated with the reign of Iyasu II [1730-55], though its roots must go further back to the earlier part of the century. The manuscript is discussed in C. Griffith Mann, Art of Ethiopia (London: Sam Fogg Rare Books, 2005), pp. 116-17. The Princeton University Library purchased it from Sam Fogg Rare Books, London, in 2012. Acc. 2012-71 Paintings: The style of the paintings belongs to the full Second or Late Gondarene style, which flourished from about 1730 onwards. Typical is the heavy modelling of the flesh and the folds of garments and draperies, the latter often with simple linear or dot decoration. Occasionally, richer patterning is shown, imitating brocade [see for example painting 29, fol. 52v]. The figures are all set against coloured backgrounds, which usually shade from green through yellow to red. Most of the pictures are also enclosed with a simple coloured frame, and sometimes elements of the picture extend into or outside the frame. A few paintings also show what look like uncoloured linear drawings of figures or architectural details that extend outside the frame. The palette is predominately dark red, vermilion, green, yellow, dark blue, purple and brown.","Date and Provenance: Probably commissioned by the King Dawit III (reigned 1716-21). Though partially erased, the name Dawit appears throughout the text. The form of words does not include the formula ""for our king,"" most often used though this is not always present in royal manuscripts. Dawit appears prostrate in one of the paintings wearing a luxurious Indian dress. Dawit's elder brother, who pre","This cataloging project was made possible through generous support from the David A.
